Following graduation from Indiana State Normal School in the spring of 1908, Diggs enrolled at Howard University in 1909. While a student there, he developed a friendship with fellow Hoosier, Byron K. Armstrong. During the summer of that year, Byron Armstrong visited his cousin, Irven Armstrong at Indiana University.

He was adept at cooking and honed those skills while working at DePauw University, where he worked as a cook in the sorority houses prior to enrolling at Indiana University. He was a fine caterer and was in demand by the White fraternities on campus and kept many of the Founding Brothers from hunger. Because of a disastrous fire in the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity house in which he was employed, he lost all of his personal belongings during his freshman year. Caine persevered but was eventually forced to withdraw from school during his Sophomore year, the winter quarter of 1911. He subsequently set up the Caine Catering Company in his hometown. He opened a restaurant and bakery while residing in Peoria, Illinois. He became well known in the culinary circles and was well sought after to teach and conduct lectures. He later acquired a secondhand goods clothing store and dry-cleaner business in Rockford, Illinois.

The circumstances of his life prevented him from moving into the circles of higher education. Edmonds' lack of contact with college colleagues prevented him from knowing the organization he assisted to found. In 1915, the Fraternity changed its name from Kappa Alpha Nu to Kappa Alpha Psi.

The Division organized at Fort Dix (New Jersey) in November 1917. The Field Artillery component was the first Negro Artillery Regiment in the history of the military. Lee served overseas as a Sergeant First Class and Gunner. His battery enjoys the unique distinction of having been the first Battery of Negro Artillerymen ever to open fire upon an enemy. In 1931, he was married to Mary Walker Robinson. For eight years, Lee conducted a successful catering business in Philadelphia; he organized and served as Vice-President and Secretary of the Mutual Emergency Union, a mutual aid company in Philadelphia. He was also a member of the Board of Managers of the Columbia Community Branch of the YMCA. Lee was a close confidant of Founder Diggs and was a source of comfort when Diggs lost his first wife. He contributed greatly to the vision and development of the fraternity in its early years. At the time of his death, he was employed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
