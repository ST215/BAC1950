    <p>{{ founders.introduction }}</p>
    <p>Kappa Alpha Psi was founded at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, at a time when African-American students faced tremendous adversity and isolation on predominantly white campuses. The ten founders—known as the "Revered Founders"—created the organization to unite men of culture, patriotism, and honor in a bond of fraternity.</p>

      <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Originally called Kappa Alpha Nu, the fraternity's name was changed to Kappa Alpha Psi on April 15, 1915, at the Grand Chapter meeting in Chicago, Illinois. This change was made to avoid being referred to pejoratively as "Kappa Alpha Nig."</p>
    <p>The fraternity quickly expanded, establishing chapters at universities across the country. By 1921, the fraternity had established chapters at over 50 institutions. Today, Kappa Alpha Psi has {{ site.fraternity.chaptersCount }} undergraduate and alumni chapters located throughout the United States, the Caribbean, United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, Japan, and other parts of the world.</p>
